# Odometry Estimation

We'd like to play around with different algorithms for estimating odometry from
inertial (and perhaps other) sensors.

TODO:

* Add information about conda environment used to run/test...
* Add how to run Jupyter notebooks...
* Notebook on least-squares filtering, show cost surface updates with EKF/InEKF
